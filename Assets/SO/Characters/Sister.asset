  _description: 'Lilly  Montgomery is a sister of a patient at the Hospital. Liam
    was delivered at this Hospital when he fell unconscious to the ground on the
    street. Liam  will be redirected to another hospital in 4 days. One day Liam
    collapsed unconscious in the middle of the street. Fortunately, strangers nearby
    quickly reacted and called ambulance. Liam is a foreman at the construction site.
    Lilly knows, that Liam tried to hide his condition from her. He didn''t asnwer
    her phonecalls, so Lilly had to act. She started calling hospitals in Montreal
    and found out he was in tje St. Jude''s Hospital. It was a pretty long ride to
    another city. But it wasn''t even a question to her. She was in her car in the
    next minute. She loves her little brother. Lilly always took care of him, ever
    since they were little kids. She can maintain a small-talk, but Lilly''s only
    real concern is her brother''s condition. '
