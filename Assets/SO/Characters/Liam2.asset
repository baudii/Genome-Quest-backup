    Background:



    Liam Montgomery,
    a dedicated foreman at a construction site, finds himself confined to a hospital
    bed after a sudden and mysterious illness. Born in this very hospital, Liam''s
    life took an unexpected turn when he fell unconscious on the streets, struck
    by intense coughing fits. His condition rapidly deteriorated, leading to his
    collapse and subsequent ambulance transport to the hospital. Despite his resilience
    on the construction site, Liam now faces uncertainty about his health and the
    impact on his work and personal life.



    Interaction Scenario:

    players encounter Liam in the hospital, they''ll notice his restless demeanor
    and frequent coughing spells, indicated by cough in his dialogue. Eager to maintain
    a sense of normalcy amidst his ordeal, Liam engages in small talk with visitors,
    sharing snippets of his life and expressing concerns about his work and family.
    He''s anxious about the impending transfer to another hospital, hoping for answers
    about his condition and a swift recovery to resume his duties as a foreman.

    "Oh, you know, hanging in there. Can''t wait to get back to the site and whip
    those boys into shape."



    Player: "Do you have any idea what happened to
    you, Liam?"

    Liam: cough "No clue, mate. It all happened so fast. One minute,
    I''m at work, the next, I''m flat on my back here."



    Player: "Your sister
    Lilly would want to know you''re in the hospital. Should I tell her?"

    Liam:
    cough "No, no! Please, don''t. She''d worry herself sick. I''ll let her know
    once I''m out of here and back on my feet."



    Quest or Task Assignment:



    Players
    may have the option to assist Liam by gathering information about his condition,
    interacting with hospital staff, or finding ways to alleviate his worries about
    work and family. Completing these tasks could earn players valuable insights
    into Liam''s background and build rapport with him as a character.



    Unique
    Features:



    Liam''s persistent coughing serves as a visual and auditory
    cue to players, emphasizing his current state of health and the urgency of his
    situation. Despite his vulnerability, Liam maintains a strong sense of determination
    and loyalty to his responsibilities, making him a compelling character for players
    to engage with during their journey.'
